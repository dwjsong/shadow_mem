shadow_mem
==========

This is a simple shadow memory tool built on 3 DBIs: PIN, Valgrind, and DynamoRIO.
I have built this shadow memory tool to compare each DBI tools based the usability, capability, and perforamnce.

There are 4 application models: Ring-buffer model, Effective address categorization, Ring-buffer + EA categorization, and Shadow address calculation
.
