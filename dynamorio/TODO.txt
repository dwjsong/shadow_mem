==Things to clarify ==

Q1: what is the DR extensions such as 'drmgr' and ''drutil'?

Q2: Must be clear about instrumentation stages of DynamoRIO.
 - They have 4 of them
   1. App-2-app translation
   2. ...
   3. ...
   4. ...

Q3: what is the meta conditional branch?

Q4: Still not clear about 'event_bb_insert' function. It only seems like to add
a single instrumentation per basic block.

Q5: how can we pickup 'dead' registers?
